#  Odin Recipes

This is my **first HTML project** from **The Odin Project – Foundations Course**.  
The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML structure by building a simple recipe website.

##  What I Learned
- How to create and structure HTML files  
- How to use headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and links  
- How to organize files inside folders  
- How to connect multiple web pages using relative links  
- How to use Git commands (add, commit, push)  
- How to publish a website using GitHub Pages  


##  About the Website
The website contains:
- A main page (`index.html`) with links to three recipes  
- Each recipe page includes:  
  - Title  
  - Image  
  - Description  
  - Ingredients list  
  - Step-by-step instructions  
  - A link back to the home page  

##  Future Improvements
Later in the course, I will:
- Add CSS to style the website  
- Add more recipes  
- Improve layout and design
